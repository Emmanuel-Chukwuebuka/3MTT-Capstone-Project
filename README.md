### Project Overview
This project aims to evaluate the Factors affecting Students' overall academic performance at School using two schools (Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira) as case studies.
### Data Source
The primary data used for this analysis is '3mtt capstone.csv', which contains detailed information about each student in the schools in view. The dataset was originally obtained from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devansodariya/student-performance-data
### Tools
- MS Excel - Data cleaning
- Data cleaning, analysis, and creating reports

### Data cleaning and preparation
In the initial data cleaning and preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading into MS Excel and Inspection
2. Handling of missing values
3. Converting the data from range to table format
4. Data cleaning and formatting using Power Query

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
EDA involved exploring the data to answer key questions, such as:
1. What is the total number of students in both schools?
2. Which school has more students?
3. What is the average performance of students in each school?
### Data Analysis Findings
- Study time is associated with better performance.
- Failures negatively impact performanceâ€”more past failures are linked to lower grades.
- Variables like travel time, free time, and family relationships have minimal correlation with performance.
- School: Students from different schools show slight variations in performance, but the difference is not substantial.
- Sex: No significant gender differences in overall performance.
- Address: Urban students slightly outperform rural students, though the difference is marginal.
- Family Support: Family size and parental cohabitation status appear to have minimal effect on performance.
- Internet access and family educational support (family support) show a slight positive association with performance.
### Recommendations
Based on the findings from the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
- Both Schools should invest more in awareness campaigns to educate the students on the importance of studying because it positively impacts the student's academic performance.
- Parents should provide more internet access to their children as it aids their education
- Extra classes should be encouraged and probably made compulsory in both schools to boost the student's academic performance
- Introduce a transport system to reduce the student's travel time to school, especially for those in rural areas.
